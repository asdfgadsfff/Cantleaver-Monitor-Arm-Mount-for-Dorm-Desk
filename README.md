# Cantleaver-Monitor-Arm-Mount-for-Dorm-Desk
Metal Extrusion "bracket" that allows for a monitor arm to be mounted to any desk with a wall behind it

## Project Overview
I designed and built a impermant and damage-free way to use a monitor arm on my school dorm's desks. This project arose after coming back on campus after being at home for 16 months due to Covid-19. I had revamped my setup to the point where a monitor arm was needed to prevent a total redesign from needing to occur.

## First Design
I started with a very complex design that I wanted to use as my own "Final Project" for my DIY fabrication. The design would combine woodwork, staining/painting, metal cutting, elctronic integration, and 3D-printing. This complex design was fully designed in Solidworks, since I would need precise build dimensions for everything. The basis for this design (and all following iterations) was 2020 Aluminum Extrusion. I had previously used this material while building an underdesk shelf for my small form factor pc. 2020 extrusion is ideal for this application because it offers great structural rigidity while still being easy to assemble and disassemble. This was vital, since I would need to take this to my school along with the rest of my belongings. As well, if the project turned out to be a failure I wanted to be able to store the project in my dorm room until given the opurtunity to move it out. 

This first design was quite extravagant, with a built in wireless charger, large wooden top, and two arms extending 40 centimeters down the back of a desk. The first design also required expensive specialty hardware like flush-mount right angle brackets and 4mm thick L-Brackets. (These brackets would then have to further modified by cutting and drilling extra holes. 

The over designing of the first iteration was due to a lack of trust in the strength of the extrusion as well as the brackets. Although I had worked with the material earlier in the year, I had forgotten how robust the extrusion was. 
## Second Iteration

After taking a break for a day I came back to my original design and noticed alot of overengineering. I realised that could save 1200mm of extrusion by going with a simpler design of the two arms. This new design still used a large wooden base, but allowed for me to extend the length of the arms to 600mm. I felt that that increasing the length of the arms was needd since longer cantileaver arms would allow for the monitor arm to hold more weight and go farther out.
## Third Iteration

The 3rd and final iteration saw a great simplification and reduction in cost and complexity. I first exchanged the large peice of wood for a much smaller square. This allowed me to use scrap wood that I already had from a previous project. I also decreased the amount of extrusion needed even further by relinging on a single 600mm length of etrusion to maintain rotational stability of the mount. Previously I had used two lengths of extrusion on the top of desk as well as spaccing the catilever arms far apart from each other. 3rd, I exchanged the modified L brackets for bolts and 2020 extrusion slot nuts. This alone allowed for a reduction of 20$ of the total cost and greatly simplified the final product as well as decreased the number of fabrication mistakes possible. Finally, I replaced the expensive flush-mount right angle brackets by tapping the extrusion of the catileaver arms and bolting them to the desktop portion of the mount. This allowed me to gain experince in tapping aluminum for the first time as well as save money. 

All of these desing changes saved 50$, created a much more compacted device, allowed for more material to be used effectivly, and greatly simplified the design and fabrication process. 

During the fabrication process I modified the design by moving the position of the 'outrigging' extrusion peices. These pieces were originally added to the design for show, so I decided  move the pieces to the very end of the desktop extrusion and add a heavily rounded corner. I also sanded every exposed corver of the extrusion, since it can be very sharp and easily tear skin.

After fabrication was completed I added a coat of balck paint to the wood and applied a quick shot of spray paint to the exposed aluminum that would be visible while the mount is in use. 
## Results of Project 

At the time of writing the mount is has not shown the slightest bit of wobble or instability. The mount allows for easy manipulation of the monitor and the monitor arm is able to manuvere as though it was properly mounted to the desk. Installation is exceedingly simple, with only 7 hex head screws needing to be fastened. 

I am very proud of the project and I feel that this still is my DIY final project, since it shows how much more practically I am thinking. An earlier version of me would have stuck with my first iteration and suffered a great many setbacks just for the thought to occur that the project could have been accomplished much better for less expense.

My favorite aspect of the project is the two bolts that thread into the cantileaver arms. I have always wanted to use a screw tap, but had never had a good reason. After 3D printing an allignment jig I perfectly tapped both holes. It was a a very gratifying experince that stressed patience and following a set of instruction. The tapped threads combined with the countersining needed for the screw heads to not protrude into the wood makes that specific area of the project my favorite.
