Metal Extrusion framework that allows for a monitor arm to be mounted to any desk with a wall behind it. The mount is completely damage free. 

## Project Overview
I designed and built an impairment and damage-free way to use a monitor arm on my school dorm's desks. This project arose after coming back on campus after being at home for 16 months due to Covid-19. I had revamped my setup to the point where a monitor arm was needed to prevent a total redesign from needing to occur. 


The design consists of a metal framework that is sandwiched in between the wall and the desk with arms going down the back of the desk to increase the amount of force needed to tip the monitor arm.

## Initial Sketch (Very much not to scale)

The surrounding numbers is me getting an estimate on how much 2020 extrusion I will need. I was aiming to keep it under 600mm x 4 pieces. 
## First Design

I started with a very complex design that I wanted to use as my own "Final Project" for my DIY fabrication. The design would combine woodwork, staining/painting, metal cutting, electronic integration, and 3D-printing. This complex design was fully designed in Solidworks, since I would need precise build dimensions for everything. The basis for this design (and all following iterations) was 2020 Aluminum Extrusion. I had previously used this material while building an under-desk shelf for my small form factor pc. 2020 extrusion is ideal for this application because it offers great structural rigidity while still being easy to assemble and disassemble. This was vital, since I would need to take this to my school along with the rest of my belongings. As well, if the project turned out to be a failure, I wanted to be able to store the project in my dorm room until given the opportunity to move it out. 

This first design was quite extravagant, with a built-in wireless charger and large wooden top with chamfers and countersunk holes but had very short arms due to a restriction in the amount of purchasable material. The first design also required expensive specialty hardware like flush-mount right angle brackets and 4mm thick L-Brackets. (These brackets would then have to further modified by cutting and drilling extra holes.)

The over designing of the first iteration was due to a lack of trust in the strength of the extrusion as well as the brackets. Although I had worked with the material earlier in the year, I had forgotten how robust the extrusion was. I also didnâ€™t want to go through the entire build process just for the mount to break when tested for the first time.

This design also did not account for wire runs. Since I would need to create at least 20mm of space between the d4esk and the wall, it would be really easy to run cables to the monitor. Unfortunately, the large wooden plank would not allow for a good routing channel. I ended up designing a small cutout, since I did not want to ruin the look of a single large rectangle or wood. 

## Second Iteration

After taking a break for a day I came back to my original design and noticed a lot of overengineering. I realized that could save 1200mm of extrusion by going with a simpler design of the two arms. This new design still used a large wooden base but allowed for me to extend the length of the arms to 600mm. I felt that that increasing the length of the arms was needed since longer cantilever arms would allow for the monitor arm to hold more weight and go farther out.

(A good view of the major changes for this design. Notice the lack of a piece of extrusion going across the back of the bracket at the corner of the desk. This redesign both saves material as well as allows for much, much easier cable routing.)

(This image shows a back corner of the mount which has 3 mounting points to the frame and one in the wood for each corner of the mount. Although not depicted in my Solidworks file, this is the first instance where the need for threading would occur. The very back hole in this image would be threaded through the middle of the extrusion to secure it in place.)

## Third Iteration
The 3rd and final iteration saw a great simplification and reduction in cost and complexity. I first exchanged the large piece of wood for a much smaller square. This allowed me to use scrap wood that I already had from a previous project. I also decreased the amount of extrusion needed even further by relying on a single 600mm length of extrusion to maintain rotational stability of the mount. Previously I had used two lengths of extrusion on the top of desk as well as spacing the cantilever arms far apart from each other. 3rd, I exchanged the modified L brackets for bolts and 2020 extrusion slot nuts. This alone allowed for a reduction of 20$ of the total cost and greatly simplified the final product as well as decreased the number of fabrication mistakes possible. Finally, I replaced the expensive flush-mount right angle brackets by tapping the extrusion of the cantilever arms and bolting them to the desktop portion of the mount. This allowed me to gain experience in tapping aluminum for the first time as well as save money. 

All of these design changes saved 50$, created a much more compacted device, allowed for more material to be used effectively, and greatly simplified the design and fabrication process. 

During the fabrication process I modified the design by moving the position of the 'outrigging' extrusion pieces. These pieces were originally added to the design for show, so I decided  to move the pieces to the very end of the desktop extrusion and add a heavily rounded corner. I also sanded every exposed corner of the extrusion, since it can be very sharp and easily tear skin.

After fabrication was completed, I added a coat of black paint to the wood and applied a quick shot of spray paint to the exposed aluminum that would be visible while the mount is in use.

## Results of Project 

At the time of writing the mount is has not shown the slightest bit of wobble or instability. The mount allows for easy manipulation of the monitor and the monitor arm is able to maneuver as though it was properly mounted to the desk. Installation is exceedingly simple, with only 7 hex head screws needing to be fastened. 

I am very proud of the project, and I feel that this still is my DIY final project, since it shows how much more practically, I am thinking. An earlier version of me would have stuck with my first iteration and suffered a great many setbacks just for the thought to occur that the project could have been accomplished much better for less expense.

My favorite aspect of the project is the two bolts that thread into the cantilever arms. I have always wanted to use a screw tap but had never had a good reason. After 3D printing an alignment jig, I perfectly tapped both holes. It was a very gratifying experience that stressed patience and following a set of instructions. The tapped threads combined with the countersinking needed for the screw heads to not protrude into the wood makes that specific area of the project my favorite.

The part files for all of the hardware as well as the monitor arm were downloaded from Grabcad. I modified some the dimensions for my needs.
